# CITM_2_Dev_Platformer
Swap game is a puzzle-action-platformer where the player must overcome a series of challenges using their logical and motor skills.
This game was made as part of the development subject by 2 students in CITM (UPC). We've programmed the game from scratch in C++ and used free artwork.

## How to play:
### Keyboard & Mouse:
- A: Move left
- D: Move right
- Space: Jump
- Mouse left button: Throw projectile which marks objects from the charcter's hat
- Mouse right button: Swap positions with marked object
